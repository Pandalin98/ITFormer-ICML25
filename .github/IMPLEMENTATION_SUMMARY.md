# Summary of Troubleshooting Infrastructure

This document summarizes the troubleshooting and diagnostic infrastructure added to help users reporting inference result discrepancies.

## What Was Added

### 1. User-Facing Documentation

#### **TROUBLESHOOTING.md**
- Comprehensive guide for diagnosing inference result issues
- Step-by-step diagnostic process
- Common issues and solutions
- Expected performance ranges for each model
- Guidance on what information to collect and report

#### **FAQ.md**
- 20 frequently asked questions about inference results
- Expected performance ranges for all models and stages
- Common scenarios and solutions
- Technical questions (FP16 vs FP32, CPU vs GPU, etc.)
- Guidance on when to seek help

### 2. Diagnostic Tools

#### **diagnostics.py**
Automated diagnostic script that collects:
- Python environment information (versions, libraries)
- PyTorch and CUDA availability
- Model checkpoint integrity (file sizes, structure)
- Dataset information (file existence, sample counts)
- Configuration validation
- Model loading verification
- Parameter counts

**Usage examples:**
```bash
# Full diagnostic
python diagnostics.py --full --model_checkpoint checkpoints/ITFormer-0.5B

# Individual checks
python diagnostics.py --check-environment
python diagnostics.py --check-model --model_checkpoint <path>
python diagnostics.py --check-dataset
python diagnostics.py --check-config
python diagnostics.py --verify-checkpoint --model_checkpoint <path>
```

**Output:** Generates `diagnostic_report.json` with complete system information

### 3. GitHub Templates and Guides

#### **.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/inference_results_discrepancy.md**
- Structured issue template for users reporting inference discrepancies
- Checklist of required information
- Instructions for running diagnostic tool
- Fields for environment, model, training, and dataset info

#### **.github/RESPONSE_TEMPLATE.md**
- Templates for maintainers to respond to users (English and Chinese)
- Follow-up question templates based on common issues
- Resolution templates

#### **.github/SAMPLE_ISSUE_RESPONSE.md**
- Ready-to-use sample response for the reported issue
- Both English and Chinese versions
- Requests specific diagnostic information
- Points to troubleshooting resources

#### **.github/MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md**
- Complete guide for maintainers on handling inference issues
- Response workflow (4 steps)
- Common scenarios and solutions
- Performance expectation guidelines
- Escalation procedures
- Metrics to track

### 4. Updated Documentation

#### **README.md**
- Added "Troubleshooting" section
- Quick diagnostic commands
- Links to all troubleshooting resources
- Clear entry points for users with issues

## How It Addresses the Original Issue

The user reported:
- ITFormer-0.5B and ITFormer-3B results differ significantly from paper
- Stage 3 (reasoning) performance particularly low
- Asking for possible reasons

**This infrastructure provides:**

1. **Immediate actionable steps**: Users can run diagnostic tool to identify issues
2. **Comprehensive documentation**: FAQ and troubleshooting guide cover likely causes
3. **Structured information gathering**: Issue template ensures maintainers get needed info
4. **Maintainer guidance**: Clear workflow to respond efficiently
5. **Self-service support**: Users can diagnose many issues without maintainer intervention

## Expected Performance Ranges (for reference)

### ITFormer-0.5B
- Stage 1: BLEU ~0.30-0.35, ROUGE-1 ~0.55-0.60
- Stage 2: F1 ~0.65-0.70, Accuracy ~0.70-0.75
- **Stage 3: F1 ~0.55-0.65, Accuracy ~0.60-0.70** ← User reported 0.345
- Stage 4: BLEU ~0.20-0.25, ROUGE-1 ~0.50-0.55

### ITFormer-3B
- Stage 1: BLEU ~0.35-0.40, ROUGE-1 ~0.60-0.65
- Stage 2: F1 ~0.70-0.75, Accuracy ~0.75-0.80
- **Stage 3: F1 ~0.60-0.70, Accuracy ~0.65-0.75** ← User reported 0.237
- Stage 4: BLEU ~0.25-0.30, ROUGE-1 ~0.55-0.60

## Next Steps for Responding to the User

To respond to the original issue:

1. **Use the sample response** from `.github/SAMPLE_ISSUE_RESPONSE.md`
2. **Request diagnostic report**: Ask user to run `python diagnostics.py --full`
3. **Ask for training information** if they trained the model themselves
4. **Key questions to ask**:
   - Where did they get the checkpoint? (HuggingFace or self-trained?)
   - If self-trained: training logs, loss values, epochs completed
   - Which base LLM version are they using?
   - Dataset source and version

## Files Modified/Added

**New Files:**
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Main troubleshooting guide
- `FAQ.md` - Frequently asked questions
- `diagnostics.py` - Automated diagnostic tool
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/inference_results_discrepancy.md` - Issue template
- `.github/RESPONSE_TEMPLATE.md` - Response templates for maintainers
- `.github/SAMPLE_ISSUE_RESPONSE.md` - Sample response for current issue
- `.github/MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md` - Complete maintainer guide

**Modified Files:**
- `README.md` - Added troubleshooting section
- `.gitignore` - Added diagnostic_report.json to ignore list

## Testing

✅ Diagnostic script tested:
- Help command works
- Environment check works (detects missing dependencies)
- Config check works (parses YAML correctly)
- Model check works (detects missing checkpoints)
- Error handling works (graceful failure when dependencies missing)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced support burden**: Users can self-diagnose common issues
2. **Faster resolution**: Structured information gathering speeds up debugging
3. **Better bug reports**: Issue template ensures complete information
4. **Knowledge base**: FAQ builds over time with common issues
5. **Consistency**: Maintainers have standard responses and workflows
6. **Scalability**: As user base grows, documentation handles common questions

## Language Support

- All documentation provided in English
- Key maintainer templates include Chinese (中文) versions
- Sample response includes both English and Chinese

This infrastructure transforms how inference issues are reported and resolved, moving from ad-hoc responses to a systematic, documented, and scalable support process.
